/// <summary>
/// A show file whose season/episode pair matches no episode is still stored, with no
/// episode and no movie on it. Nothing can list or play such a row, and the library
/// listing only returns shows that have an episode with a playable file — so the show
/// vanishes and the library renders empty.
///
/// Verified live on v0.1.454 (2026-08-02): an Anime library with two shows imported
/// 24 episodes and 2 video files, both files were <c>S00E00</c> specials that exist in
/// no provider episode list, both rows landed with a null EpisodeId, and the library
/// endpoint answered <c>NMGrid</c> with <c>items: []</c>. Seven music folders that
/// failed the same day each wrote an ImportFailure row; these two wrote nothing, so
/// there was no screen anywhere that could explain the empty library.
