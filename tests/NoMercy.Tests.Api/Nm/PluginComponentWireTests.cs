/// <summary>
/// What a plugin's tree looks like once it is on the wire.
///
/// The design system declares children and the action on
/// <c>NMComponentBase</c> — the props every component extends — and every client
/// renders from that. This type declared them beside props instead, which type
/// checks on both sides and draws nothing: the payload carried children the
/// clients never looked for, so every card arrived with an empty body and every
/// card that named a destination sat there.
///
/// Nothing caught it, because every test asserted the C# objects rather than the
/// bytes. Then these asserted the bytes — through
/// <c>System.Text.Json</c>, which no response in this server is written with.
/// They passed on a serializer nobody uses while every card on screen stayed
/// empty. The settings below are the ones MVC builds for the pipeline the API
/// registers, so a wire assertion here is an assertion about the wire.
