# The order matters and is the reason this is a script rather than three
# commands: csharpier rewrites files, so formatting after a green test run
# leaves the tested bytes and the committed bytes different. Formatting first
# means what was tested is what lands.

# A file list, never the project: a whole-project format touches uncommitted
# work in progress that has nothing to do with the change being gated.
