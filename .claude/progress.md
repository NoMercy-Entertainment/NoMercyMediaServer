## CHAR-01 — Set up `NoMercy.Tests.Api` project with `WebApplicationFactory` and auth helpers

**Date**: 2026-02-07

**What was done**:
- Created `tests/NoMercy.Tests.Api/` project with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` and `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`
- Added project to solution under Tests folder
- Created `Infrastructure/NoMercyApiFactory.cs` — custom `WebApplicationFactory<Startup>` that:
  - Overrides `CreateWebHostBuilder()` to bootstrap the server without SSL certs or real network setup
  - Registers `StartupOptions`, `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider`, `ISunsetPolicyManager` needed by `Startup` constructor
  - Removes all `IHostedService` registrations to prevent background jobs from running during tests
  - Replaces JWT Bearer auth with a test authentication scheme
  - Replaces the `"api"` authorization policy with a simple authenticated-user policy
  - Ensures `AppFiles` data directories exist and seeds the SQLite database with a test user before server startup
  - Populates `ClaimsPrincipleExtensions.Users` static list so auth checks work
- Created `Infrastructure/TestAuthHandler.cs` — per-request test auth handler using `X-Test-Auth` header to control authentication (avoids shared static state between parallel tests)
- Created `Infrastructure/HttpClientAuthExtensions.cs` — `AsAuthenticated()` / `AsUnauthenticated()` extension methods for `HttpClient`
- Created `HealthControllerTests.cs` — 2 tests verifying `/health` and `/health/detailed` endpoints
- Created `AuthenticationTests.cs` — 3 tests verifying anonymous endpoint access, authenticated endpoint access, and unauthenticated rejection

**Test results**: 5 new tests pass. All 517 tests (5 new + 512 existing) pass with `dotnet build && dotnet test`.
