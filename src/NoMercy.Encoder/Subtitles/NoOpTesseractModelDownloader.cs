/// Default placeholder. The encoder registers this via <c>TryAddSingleton</c> so
/// <see cref="TesseractModelManager"/> (and any consumer that merely resolves it) always
/// resolves in an encoder-only DI container — mirroring
/// <see cref="NoOpOpenSubtitlesProvider"/>'s registration pattern. The Service host
/// registers the real signature/hash-verifying <c>TesseractModelDownloader</c> (in
/// NoMercy.Setup) after the encoder's own registration, replacing this via standard DI
/// last-wins.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Unlike <see cref="NoOpOpenSubtitlesProvider"/> (whose no-op result — an empty search —
/// is a benign, valid outcome), an unverified model has no benign placeholder: writing
/// arbitrary bytes to disk as a "downloaded" language model would be a real correctness
/// and security regression if this default were ever actually invoked outside a test. It
/// throws instead of returning fabricated data.
