/// Changing what is in a user's library: the highest-risk thing a plugin can

/// A plugin could already delete a user's media, because it runs in-process and
/// <c>System.IO</c> is right there. Nothing declared it, nothing prompted, and
/// nothing bounded where it could reach. The hole was exactly where the
/// consequences are worst.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Four things make this safe to hand out, and all four matter:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>It is its own capability, so declaring it is visible in the manifest
/// and deliberate.</item>
/// <item>It is elevated by definition, so it can never ride in on a baseline
/// auto-enable — the owner grants it or it does not happen.</item>
/// <item>It is jailed to the libraries the owner granted, by id, and every path
/// resolves through the storage facade rather than raw file calls, so the jail
/// is enforced where the rest of the server enforces it.</item>
/// <item><see cref="RecycleAsync"/> exists so a plugin can be built to never
/// hard-delete, and is what a well-behaved plugin calls instead of
/// <see cref="DeleteAsync"/>.</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Every method throws when the plugin holds no grant for the library the path
/// belongs to, and when the path escapes that library's root. Neither is a
/// return value: a plugin that ignores a false and carries on would be the
/// whole problem back again.
