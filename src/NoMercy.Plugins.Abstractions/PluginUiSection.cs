/// Where a plugin's UI mount appears.

/// <see cref="PluginUiMount.Section"/> was a required string with no stated
/// values, so an author had to guess and guessing wrong was silent — the mount
/// rendered nowhere, or somewhere unintended, and neither is an error anyone
/// sees. Naming the values makes a typo a compile error instead.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// An unknown section is NOT rejected. A client that does not know a section
/// falls back to <see cref="Addon"/>, because the alternative is that adding a
/// section to one client turns every plugin using it into a validation failure
/// on the other. Every section here needs a home in both the web sidebar and
/// the KMP navigation; a section one client knows and the other does not is the

/// These are <c>PluginKind</c>'s values, and they have to stay its values. The
/// list here used to read <c>movies</c>, <c>shows</c> and <c>tools</c>, none of

/// <c>PluginKind.IsKnown</c> and was quietly re-homed to the dashboard, so a
/// plugin that asked to appear beside films appeared in the admin panel and its
/// author had no way to find out. The drift this file warns about had happened
