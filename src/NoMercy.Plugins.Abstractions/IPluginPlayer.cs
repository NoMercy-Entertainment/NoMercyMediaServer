/// What a plugin may ask a player to do.
///
/// A plugin never holds a player. The server has no player: the player lives in
/// whichever client the viewer is looking at, and there may be several. So a
/// plugin sends an intent to a session and the client that owns the player acts
/// on it.
///
/// That indirection is what makes casting work without a plugin knowing casting
/// exists. A client already decides whether audio comes out of its own speakers
/// or goes to a cast device, and an intent arriving at that client goes wherever
/// its audio was already going. A plugin handed a real player would have bound
/// itself to one output and broken the moment the viewer cast.
///
/// Typed convenience over <see cref="PluginCapability.Player" /> rather than a
/// mechanism of its own. Nothing here does anything an InvokeAsync call cannot,
/// which is deliberate: a capability reachable only through its own interface
/// would be one that older plugins could never discover.
