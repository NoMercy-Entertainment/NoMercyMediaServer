/// The rule is that secrets are protected and stored in the database, never in
/// config and never in an environment variable. A plugin had no way to obey it:
/// <see cref="IPluginConfiguration"/> is whole-object JSON on disk, so a
/// password written through it lands in plaintext, and the alternative was to
/// resolve a data-protection provider out of the service provider and hand-roll
/// the rest.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The store is scoped to the calling plugin. Keys are namespaced by plugin id
/// by the implementation rather than by the caller, so one plugin cannot read
/// another's secrets by guessing a key, and a plugin cannot widen its own scope
/// by choosing a clever one.
