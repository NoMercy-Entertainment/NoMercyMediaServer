/// There was no way to ask, so a plugin reached the server's own types by name
/// through <see cref="IPluginContext.Services" /> and drove them with reflection.
/// Between 22 and 24 August 2026 that construction broke four separate times and
/// every break looked identical from the outside: the plugin simply never
/// encoded anything, for days, while all of its tests stayed green. An overload
/// was added and <c>GetMethod</c> threw; a property changed from text to
/// <c>Ulid</c> and <c>SetValue</c> threw; a method started returning a
/// <c>Task</c> and the plugin walked it as a list and found nothing; two
/// interfaces shared a name and the unregistered one resolved to null. A
/// compiler catches none of those, and none of them produce an error an owner
/// can act on.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// Ids are text in both directions, as the rest of this contract already spells
/// them, so a plugin never has to know <c>Ulid</c> exists.
