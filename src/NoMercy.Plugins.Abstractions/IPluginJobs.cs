/// A plugin that owns files has to know. The torrent downloader stages a copy

/// With nothing to read, a plugin infers the outcome from the library, and that

/// like one still running - both are "the library does not have it yet", for
/// ever - so the owner waits for an episode that will never arrive with no line
/// anywhere saying why. And a file that arrived some other way looks like
/// success, so the plugin deletes its download believing its own encode
