/// <summary>
/// Phase 4.14 — startup orphan-job recovery. On boot, scans the queue for
/// jobs left in "running" state (<c>ReservedAt != null</c>) by a previous
/// shutdown that are older than the cutoff window.
///
/// Checkpoint-aware triage (Phase 4.14b): encoder-queue orphans that have a
/// crash checkpoint are re-queued with Attempts=0 so the resume path gets a
/// chance to pick up from the last-known keyframe position. Orphans with no
/// checkpoint follow the original logic: a genuine first-time orphan (reserved
/// exactly once — <c>Attempts &lt;= 1</c>, since <c>ReserveJob</c> increments
/// Attempts in the same write that sets ReservedAt) gets one clean retry with
/// its reservation released and its attempt budget refunded; an orphan that
/// has already burned a prior attempt beyond that single reservation
/// (<c>Attempts &gt; 1</c>) is a repeat offender and moves to FailedJobs so it
/// can't retry forever.
///
/// This is a one-shot pass: nothing runs yet when the host boots, so a 30s
/// wall-clock cutoff applied to every queue (encoder included) is safe here.
/// Once the server is up, reclaiming a stuck reservation is no longer
/// unconditionally safe for long-running jobs — see
/// <see cref="StuckReservationReaperHostedService"/>, which runs the same
/// <see cref="OrphanRecoveryTriage"/> logic periodically but only against an
/// allow-list of queues known to finish in seconds-to-minutes (encoder AND
/// library/import are excluded — see that class for why).
