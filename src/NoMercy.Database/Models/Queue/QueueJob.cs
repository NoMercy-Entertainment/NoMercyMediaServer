// Every Dispatch dedups via QueueJobs.Any(j => j.Payload == x). Without an index
// that is a full scan of the (large, history-retaining) queue table — seconds per
// enqueue, which surfaced as multi-second endpoints that dispatch a job inline.
//
// Indexed by hash rather than by the payload: indexing Payload meant a B-tree over
// the payloads themselves, and music encode payloads run to a megabyte each, so the
// index grew to the size of the table and took queue.db to 23.6GB — half of it this
// one index. The lookup still confirms against the real payload, so dedup decides
// on the same equality it always did.
[Index(nameof(PayloadHash))]
// Serves the sweep that reclaims shared input no queued job still reads.
[Index(nameof(SharedInputKey))]
// Every worker poll reserves via (Queue, ReservedAt IS NULL, Attempts, AvailableAt)
// ordered by (Priority desc, CreatedAt, Id). The sort index above cannot serve that
// — the predicate leads with Queue — so SQLite fell back to SCAN + a temp B-tree
// over the whole table: ~2.7s per reserve at 116k rows, taken while JobQueue holds
// its global write lock, which serialises every worker on every queue. Leading with
// Queue and ReservedAt turns it into a SEARCH and lets the trailing columns satisfy
// the ORDER BY. Measured 2741ms -> 87ms on a copy of a real 2.5GB queue.db.
