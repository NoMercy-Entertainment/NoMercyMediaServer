/// Resolves the server's stable identity Guid — the value sent to
/// api.nomercy.tv as "id" during registration (<see cref="Info.DeviceId"/>).
/// A pure hardware fingerprint (motherboard + drive serials) collides across
/// containerized/VM installs: Docker/KVM/VPS environments frequently expose an
/// empty or provider-wide-shared serial, so two different installs of the same
/// image hash to the SAME Guid and the second one to register gets rejected by
/// the backend as "registered to another account". Once resolved here, the id
/// is persisted in app.db and never recomputed — existing registered servers
/// keep the exact hardware-derived id their DNS subdomain and certificate were
/// issued for; a genuinely new/never-registered install gets a fresh unique id.
///
/// The degenerate-id migration is scoped to containers only. Empty/shared DMI
/// serials are a containerized-install phenomenon; a bare-metal box reads a real,
/// stable fingerprint and its DNS subdomain + certificate were issued for exactly
/// that id, so it is returned untouched — changing a bare-metal server's id would
/// break the identity it already registered. Inside a container, a box registered
/// on one of the <see cref="KnownDegenerateDeviceIds"/> values is NOT preserved —
/// that id is shared with every other container that hit the same empty-DMI probe,
/// so "prior registration evidence" proves nothing about uniqueness. It is migrated
/// to a fresh Guid, even with an ssl_certificate on file. That certificate/DNS entry
/// was never uniquely this box's anyway, so the migration also deletes the stale
/// ssl_certificate/ssl_private_key rows — leaving them would make
/// <c>CertificateService.HasValidCertificate()</c> (and therefore BootOrchestrator's
/// "is this server registered" check) keep reporting true for a certificate that
/// doesn't cover the new id, silently skipping re-registration. Auth tokens are never
/// touched, so the re-registration that follows is non-interactive.
